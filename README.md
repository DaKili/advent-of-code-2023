# advent-of-code-2023

My personal repository for solving advent of code 2023 using golang.<br>
I focus on improving performance by parallelizing code.

Add your input in the corresponding /day-\<number\> folder.<br>
Update the task you want to solve in `main.go` and execute `go run .` from the root directory or if you use VSCode press F5.
